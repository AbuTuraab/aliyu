        <h4>What are Cryptocurrencies</h4>
        Introduction
        As the popularity and mainstream acceptance of blockchain and digital assets
        increase, traditional investors have been looking for more exposure to these
        digital assets and blockchain based technologies. However, many things can be
        “lost in translation” when it comes to integrating the digital currency world and
        the world of traditional finances. Providing a seamless exchange between crypto
        and conventional assets is the underlying philosophy behind Cryptopay
        expansion and Initial Coin Offering (ICO).
        Investors, who use digital currencies, currently have to interact with several
        counterparties to successfully manage their risks and portfolio. These
        counterparties being traditional banks, payment networks and financial services
        companies. The majority of them don’t understand the nature of digital
        currencies, which can cause frustration, account freezes, losses and not to
        mention the various inefficiencies that come with moving between the different
        asset classes.
        With the emergence of blockchain, a growing number of users and businesses
        are beginning to struggle leveraging the existing infrastructure in order to
        manage the transfer of funds between physical and virtual platforms.
        As of now, Cryptopay provides the ability to spend, save, and transact digital
        currencies. The Cryptopay wallet allows users to effortless trade between bitcoin
        and fiat currencies, specifically the GBP, USD, and the EUR. This wallet service is
        complemented by a prepaid card that lets users quickly access funds stored in
        cryptocurrencies. Soon hereafter, we are launching the a service that will allow
        users access to equities and the ability to own current accounts.

        Bitcoin [1] has demonstrated a new approach to securely storing data
        in the cloud. The Bitcoin database services millions of users around the planet
        and has thus far shown itself to be essentially invulnerable to attack. Bitcoin does
        not require boundary defenses to protect the integrity of the database, instead it
        relies on a consensus of peers to build an independently verifiable historical
        record. To alter past revisions to the database, an attacker must wield computing
        power in excess of the combined power of honest participants in network.
        ChainDB seeks to apply that same approach to securing arbitrary sets of data in
        the cloud. However, rather than create yet another Bitcoin clone that requires its
        own mining network, ChainDB uses the existing Bitcoin mining network. In this
        paper, we outline the ChainDB consensus mechanism.
